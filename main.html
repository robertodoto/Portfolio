        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p class="selfdescription">Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Roberto Doto, and I have a diverse background that combines language studies and technology. I earned my degree in Languages and Teaching Italian as a Foreign Language, which led me to spend several rewarding years teaching in the field of integration. 
          <br><br>Throughout my teaching career, I developed a passion for helping others connect through language and culture. However, I felt a strong desire to embrace new challenges and explore the world of technology. This motivated me to enroll in the Full Stack Engineer course at Codecademy, where I am honing my skills in web development and programming.
          <br><br>I am excited to merge my educational background with my newfound technical expertise to create meaningful and user-friendly digital experiences. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
